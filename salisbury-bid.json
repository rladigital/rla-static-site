So we grew an organic email database that is specifically GDPR compliant. We also leveraged Facebook lead generation adverts and third-party email newsletters, culminating in a Christmas campaign promoting the hugely popular Christmas market.\n\n# THE OUTCOME\n\nWithin the first week our data capture campaign via Facebook lead generation posts built up an organic email database of 1,500 and a substantial social media following who can are now happy to be targeted with events, offers and news.
