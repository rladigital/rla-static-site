So we grew an organic email database that is specifically GDPR compliant. We also leveraged Facebook lead generation adverts and third-party email newsletters, culminating in a Christmas campaign promoting the hugely popular Christmas market.\n\n# THE OUTCOME\n\nWithin the first week our data capture campaign via Facebook lead generation posts built up an organic email database of 1,500 and a substantial social media following who are now happy to be targeted with events, offers and news. In light of the GDPR ruling requiring the publicâ€™s consent for further communications we were delighted that 67% of recipients opted IN.","objects":{"entry":{"path":"src/pages/work/salisbury-bid.md","sha":"5b7f275f1008215598c3cf38f480020e8beb296c"},"files":[]},"timeStamp":"2018-04-23T13:05:09.095Z"}
