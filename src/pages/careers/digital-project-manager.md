  * Work with creative, strategy, planning & digital teams to deliver a solution
  that always pushes the client brief ensuring proactivity is at the heart of
  everything we do.

  * Develop and maintain a strong relationship with the client and account
  teams, including third party teams.

  * Understand hosting and data protection requirements in order to work in
  collaboration with the IT Manager to ensure data security and GDPR compliance
  for digital projects.
