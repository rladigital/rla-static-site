  # About Us


  We’ve got a great new opportunity for a Front End Developer to join our team!


  RLA are a hugely successful full service creative agency, with offices in
  Bournemouth, Belfast and London. From the moment we opened our doors 30 years

  we are part of the Mission group, the fifth largest communications group in
  the UK.


  We look for people who share and can demonstrate our core values; Agile,
  Astute, Can-Do, Inspiring, Trusted, Together. In return, we can offer you a
  great place to work in an environment that encourages continuous
  self-improvement and development. What’s more, you’ll have the best of both
  worlds as you’ll be based in a beautiful, relaxed countryside location, but be
  just a 20-minute drive to the beach!
