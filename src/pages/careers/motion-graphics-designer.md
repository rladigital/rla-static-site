  ## About Us


  With a 30-year pedigree and a client base to be hugely proud of, RLA is a
  full-service advertising and marketing communications agency based in a
  beautiful converted barn in Bournemouth. You’ll have the best of both worlds
  as you’ll be based in a stunning, relaxed countryside location, but be just a
  20-minute drive to Dorset’s finest beaches!


  We’re looking for a Motion Graphics designer with agency experience to join
  our growing team. Having established ourselves in this area with our leading
  automotive clients, we’re looking to expand our offering and grow the team to
  help deliver more high-quality, effective video content.


  ## The Role


  We’re on the lookout for someone with bundles of talent, taste and a real
  passion for motion work. You’ll need to be pragmatic, and empathetic to our
  client’s needs, and ace at getting into the mind of consumers. You’ll be able
  to leverage strategy and creativity to produce impactful, emotional, memorable
  content.


  In close collaboration with the Creative and Studio Team, day-to-day tasks
  will involve creating awesome, engaging video content from scratch, including
  conceptual thinking, visual development, production and delivery using Adobe
  Creative Suite (After-Effects and Premier, with a knowledge of the other apps
  that feed into these).


  The team you’ll be working alongside are a passionate bunch, and some of
  Bournemouth’s finest Designers, Art Directors, Writers and Artworkers, all
  producing work for big-name clients including BMW, Peugeot, Scania and Volvo.


  ## Responsibilities Include


  * Receiving, understanding and progressing creative briefs.

  * The ability to think strategically about Motion Graphics.

  * A keen sense of visual timing, narrative and storytelling.

  * Working with Art Directors to develop creative treatments, styleframes,
  storyboards and animation.

  * Designing and preparing content for use in various spaces, including social,
  event stands, presentations and websites.


  ## About you


  * You have a portfolio website or reel displaying beautifully-crafted Motion
  Graphics content.

  * You have a passion for the Motion Graphics, and a keen interest in pushing
  forward with the latest developments and technologies (e.g. 3D rendering).

  * You’re a ‘people person’ who enjoys collaborating with teams.

  * You’re able to take on and work with constructive feedback with a positive
  approach.

  * You have a keen eye for detail, and strong typographic skills.

  * You’re a hands-on person, who will happily muck in where possible when the
  team needs help.

  * Experience of working within deadlines is a must, and an ability to take on
  feedback within the team is essential.

  * Some experience in working with Adobe Photoshop / Illustrator is required,
  and any specialist experience in areas like Cinema 4D, or videography will be
  of great interest and help you stand out. We’re also open to hybrid Graphic /
  Motion designers, but the Motion skillset needs to be highly developed.


  ## The Rewards


  * True professional development – we look to support creative skills growth
  with internal support and coaching, alongside online and in-person training
  and courses.

  * 28 days’ holiday (plus bank holidays.) After 5 years’ continuous service, an
  additional 3 days’ holiday to use during that anniversary year

  * Your birthday as a day off

  * Eye Care Scheme

  * Refer A Friend Scheme

  * Cycle to Work Scheme

  * Reward & Recognition Scheme

  * Fridge Friday

  * Free parking

  * The chance to join RLA’s world-beating frisbee and surfing teams!
