      Outdated and uninspired, Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles needed new
      advertising material that could effectively differentiate an aging product
      and a style that mimicked a passenger car in a highly competitive market. 




      With as little as 50% of Volkswagen’s LCV dealerships utilising existing
      marketing collateral, RLA needed to create something that not only
      inspired the end consumer but engaged the Volkswagen dealer network as
      well.

    title: The Problem
  - description: >-
      RLA’s aggressive redefinition of Volkswagen’s LCV audience targeting went
      through several major phases - culminating in the bold and award-winning
      brand campaign, ‘Let’s Go To Work’. With Ray Winstone voicing the rallying
      cry via a series of radio adverts, and a suite of press and OOH assets in
      support, the whole network got behind the campaign and brought Volkswagen
      Commercial Vehicles back to life.

    title: The Strategy
  - description: >-
      Running for over 6 years, RLA’s campaign was the most commercially
      successful in Volkswagen’s LCV history; contributing to a 40% increase in
      market share, more than doubling vehicle sales. 


      ‘Let’s Go To Work’ tripled purchase consideration, leapfrogged Volkswagen
      from 8th to 2nd in the Brand pressure Index and grew Dealer participation
      and local marketing engagement by 440%! 


      The campaign was ultimately voted as one of the 10 best B2B campaigns of
      the decade by B2B Marketing.
