intro: >-
  In attracting increasing volumes of premium customers, the brand needs to
  adapt its sales behaviours with customers to continue to exceed their
  expectations
project: >-
  Sometimes the ‘How?’ is just as important as the ‘How many?’ When Volvo wanted
  to change their sales behaviours to meet new customer expectations, they came
  to RLA.




  We’re proud to be tasked with supporting Volvo Car UK’s next phase of ongoing
  sales success through the creation of a bespoke sales and behaviour
  performance programme. Named Volvo First Class, it utilises both on and
  offline communications, focusing on national and local dealer behaviours,
  knowledge and skill application.
outcome: >-
  March 2014 saw the launch of the initial phase of the programme, an
  interactive internet hub which lies at the centre of the reward and
  recognition platform. With the resource of a dedicated account team, RLA will
  pro-actively assist Volvo Car UK in achieving its performance growth in the UK
  over the next three years.




  Together, we are a valuable extension of your marketing team.
