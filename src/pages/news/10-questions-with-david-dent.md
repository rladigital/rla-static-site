**Ok, so what do you actually do?**

I consider clients problems and objectives and translate these into a strategy. I see things from the eyes of the consumer to understand what messages (and where) will help them reach a positive buying decision. I work closely with our creative teams to develop effective work, and with Client Services on the delivery. I am ably supported by a great team who are brilliant at surfacing insight from the vast amounts of client data we access, and am ultimately accountable for effectiveness.

**What makes working at RLA different to other agencies?**

It has to be the people, that’s what makes any agency special. I think we have a lot of individuals with very diverse skills and approaches. It somehow seems to gel, which is why we are very comfortable fusing technology and creativity, something many agencies without our culture struggle to do properly.

**What’s your best memory from RLA so far?**

My team winning the Summer Sports Day trophy from Lucy, our FD – she’s so competitive and maybe not the best loser.

**When you’re not in the barn, what do you get up to?**

I love anything to do with water, sailing, windsurfing, kayaking, that’s my main escape. Spending time with my family and friends is when I’m happiest but mowing lawns and weeding often gets in the way. I enjoy watching sport, lots of Rugby and the mighty Chelsea FC.

**What are you most proud of?**

Well I’ve worked on award winning campaigns, won National and European sailing championships, I probably should say my kids, but the one thing that really stands out is learning to play the Bongos (I’m tone deaf).

**What would you do if you weren’t in the marketing industry?**

Probably live a lot longer! I have tried to escape our industry, but always been drawn back - I did a degree in Acupuncture and studied for a Masters in Sports Science, I owned a pub and did some yachting. My ultimate dream though would be to own a Rum distillery in the Caribbean.

**You’re in control of the Sonos, what are we listening to?**

I’ve got a really eclectic taste, maybe some reggae, dance, or rock - definitely something that would embarrass my daughter.

**Which other RLAer is most awesome and why?**

Now I know I’m going to be ribbed for saying this but it has to be Sam, our MD. She embraces all things good, has time for everyone no matter how busy, and always has a smile on her face whatever.

**What is your dream client?**

That would have to be Mount Gay Rum – the head office visits to Barbados, and the product tasting.

**What makes a good Planner?**

For me it’s about being curious. You have to love people and want to understand what makes them tick. The Apple ‘Think Different’ ad from 1997 captured it:

> _“Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They're not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can't do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.”_
