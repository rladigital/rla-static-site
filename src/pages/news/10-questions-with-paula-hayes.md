**What's your role at RLA?**

Group Account Director

**OK, so what do you actually do?**

I head up a couple of major automotive client accounts – BMW & MINI Global Trade Parts and Volvo UK Reward and Recognition Programme, as well as Ocean Automotive. I also look after the new starters to RLA and make sure they are fully inducted into the business.

**What makes working at RLA different to other agencies?**

I’ve not worked in an agency before, but have worked with many whilst client side. What is different at RLA are the people. The talent, expertise, enthusiasm and desire to do a great job is endemic across the agency, and that is what makes is a cracking place to work.

**When you're not in the barn, what do you get up to?**

I would like to say sky diving or wind surfing, but to be honest I love just spending time with my family at home, cooking, working in the garden and playing with the chickens. Try to squeeze in the odd horse ride when I can.

**What are you most proud of (career, personal, go for broke)?**

My children.

**You're in control of the Sonos, what are we listening to?**

Opera - That’s why they don’t let me control the Sonos!

**We're on a pitch and it's pizza time, what are you ordering?**

Totally boring – Margherita – Can’t help it – it’s my fave

**Which other RLAer is most awesome and why?**

That's a tough one - everyone is awesome, but if I had to choose one person it would be Andy Orritt, our Studio Manager. He is always so helpful and supportive and when things get a bit stressful he is always there smiling and ensuring everything gets done.

**How would you describe your ideal client relationship?**

The best client relationships are based on honesty and reliability and doing what you say you are going to do, when you say you are going to do it. It’s not rocket science – just treat people the way you expect to be treated yourself.

**Summarise RLA in one word.**

Inspirational.
