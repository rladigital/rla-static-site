**What’s your role at RLA?**

Studio and Traffic Manager.

**Ok, so what do you actually do?**

I make sure that when the work leaves the agency it is the best it can possibly be, on-time and on-budget. I work out who’s doing what and when, question briefs, point and laugh at Sean, that kind of thing. It’s the most important role in the agency (probably).

**What makes working at RLA different to other agencies?**

The spirit. When everyone and everything somehow comes together on a project and we all pull together, even it’s a 2am finish, there’s nothing quite that satisfying in this business.

**What industry trend or technology are you most excited about?**

Being studio based, it would have to be the ever-evolving tools we have, things like Cinema 4D and Adobe XD. we’re able to render 3D environments or prototype an entire site or application, with functionality, for approval and then into build or design really efficiently.

**What’s your best memory from RLA so far?**

Screaming “grab the balls” repeatedly at our commercial director, Paul Smith, while we were taking part in human Hungry, Hungry Hippos on our inaugural Sports Day.

**When you’re not in the barn, what do you get up to?**

During the week, mainly being tired. I have 3 children, so weeknights are pretty much a siege negotiation until they are in bed. My weekends are filled with under-12s football, trips to the beach/forest, constantly 'sorting out' the garage, under-10s football and swimming lessons. When I do get a couple of hours to myself, I’ll more than likely fall asleep watching either Match of the Day, or the worst film currently available on Netflix.

**What would you do if you weren’t in the marketing industry?**

I trained as a chef back in my early twenties, so I’d like to think I’d have a chain of incredibly successful restaurants, written several best-selling cookery books, be well into filming the fourth season of my tv show, in which I travel the world eating and drinking the finest food and beverages, and every now and then turn up on Saturday Kitchen and make an omelette.

**You’re in control of the Sonos, what are we listening to?**

Radiohead is always a good shout, particularly their ‘challenging’ albums, because it has the capacity to annoy 96% of the Agency. Failing that literally anything by The Beastie Boys.

**It’s Friday, its 4 o’clock, the beer fridge is open. What are you grabbing?**

Anything cold, but ideally anything cold with IPA in the name.

**What’s your favourite part of the job?**

The people I work with. Seriously, if the people around you day in, day out, don’t inspire you to better things then you’re probably in the wrong job.
