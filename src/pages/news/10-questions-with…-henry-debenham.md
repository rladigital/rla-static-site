**What’s your role at RLA?**

As Client Services Director I have a wide and varied role. Principally I look after all aspects of the client services team from resourcing, project and client management, training, development and finance. I also help put the objectives and strategy in place to ensure we grow and develop as an agency, embracing the latest thinking, tools and channels to deliver the most creative and effective communications for our clients.

**Ok, so what do you actually do?**

I have a lot of meetings where I actively listen to what clients and my team are telling me to help understand and solve problems together. I encourage, inspire and challenge the people I work with to be the very best we can be. I create an open environment where we can collaborate and innovate to find new ways of doing things that make a real difference. And above all that we enjoy what we do and have a passion for being creative. 

**What makes working at RLA different to other agencies?**

My experience of other agencies to date has all been working in London. So being in a barn surrounded by fields with horses trotting past and a duck pond makes it pretty different! But the biggest difference is the ability of RLA to deliver fantastic communications with true end to end solutions in house, including complex website and portal builds, with data insight at the heart of everything we do.

**What industry trend or technology are you most excited about?**

There has never been a more exciting time to work in marketing with so many new tools and channels at our finger tips allowing us to connect with customers and more importantly create real connections between consumers and brands. The trend I’m most excited about would have to be content and in particular the merging of film with digital interactivity making it a truly interactive medium with seamless customer journeys woven in. 

**When you’re not in the barn, what do you get up to?**

I have a young family, so I love to spend as much time with them as possible, going on adventures and experiencing new things. With the move down to Bournemouth I’m looking forward to getting back into all sorts of outdoor pursuits from playing tennis and mountain biking to surfing and sailing.

**What are you most proud of (career, personal, go for broke)?**

I’ve worked on a number of businesses that have won awards for their creativity and effectiveness that I’m pretty proud of but the thing I’m most proud of is my curiosity and pursuit of learning and experiencing new types of agency, client and communications. I’ve never let uncertainty or fear stop me from making a change, even when that means leaving the comfort and security of what you currently have. So, I’m also really proud of my wife Jenny for letting me pursue my career without boundaries and always supporting me!

**You’re in control of the Sonos, what are we listening to?
**

I love a huge range of music from feel good classics to Indie to the latest chart music but the band that I grew up with, was my first concert and whose song we had our first wedding dance to is Guns ‘n’ Roses. So, at some point, I’ll always reach for Appetite for Destruction.

**We’re on a pitch and it’s pizza time, what are you ordering?**

Something hot and spicy

**Summarise RLA in one word.**

Unique

**What’s your favourite part of the job?**

It’s that moment when you are working with the team and the client and hit upon an idea that can unlock the potential of the product or service you are selling. It creates complete clarity and gives everyone a focus, drive and energy to make it happen.
