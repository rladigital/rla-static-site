**What's your role at RLA?**

Marketing Manager

**Ok, so what do you actually do?**

Aside from being the resident office duster, my primary responsibility is to show the world how awesome RLA are. Marketing has always been a passion of mine, so to be able to market a ‘marketing’ agency is the perfect challenge for me.

**What makes working at RLA different to other agencies?**

RLA care. Simple as that. We care about our work. We care about our clients. And we care about each other. Since I joined RLA, we have had plenty of ups and some downs as an agency, but I have also had plenty of ups and downs of my own since joining RLA 2 years ago (grab a violin). RLA’s support through these ‘downs’ has been incredible and I feel so lucky to work with such genuinely good people. 

**What’s your best memory from RLA so far?**

Our Christmas parties have always been VERY memorable. But my favourite memory has to be when a few of us went to Devon for a RLA surf trip. A great laugh and even better waves!

**When you’re not in the barn, what do you get up to?**

I have always loved being outdoors. Since moving down to Bournemouth I have taken up surfing and love nothing more than to battle the waves all year round. A keen sportsman, I play a lot of football, basketball and volleyball; and particularly love a run along the beach after work.  I also have a 3 year old daughter who likes to keep me on my toes!

**What would you do if you weren’t in the marketing industry?**

I volunteered for 2 years in South Africa when I was 20 years old, and if I wasn’t working in the marketing industry I would love to still be doing that! Best experience of my life (after marrying my wife, and the birth of my daughter ofcourse…..)!

**What industry trend or technology are you most excited about?**

There is so much to choose from! For me, I am most excited to see the influence of VR/AR. Cinema has long priced brands out of creating truly immersive brand experiences; as VR/AR becomes more and more common it will be interesting to see how more brands will be able to creatively use this totally immersive platform to deliver meaningful experiences for consumers.

**We’re on a pitch and it’s pizza time, what are you ordering?**

If we are going to go by our latest pitch, then I am ordering double the amount of pizza than the team actually need…much to the bemusement of my colleagues. I LOVE food. Especially Pizza. Papa John’s over Dominos all day. 

**Which other RLAer is most awesome and why?**

I would have to say Paul Weir (sorry Jonny). The way that man surfs a wave is a thing of beauty. My aim is to reach those dizzy heights of majesty one day.

**Summarise RLA in one word.**

Exciting.
