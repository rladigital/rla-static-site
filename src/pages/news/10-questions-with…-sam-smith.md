Most manufacturer-run trade parts programmes operate to a business model that is now well over 20 years old. However, parts retailing has changed immeasurably over the last decade with the growth of several disruptive and capable competitors which has seen many OEM’s share of the market slowly decline. But not for RLA’s client, PSA Group who are about to take their already successful Trade Team programme to the next level by launching the industry’s first OEM rewards programme, PERKS, on the 5th June 2017. 



Targeted at 25,000 Independent Garages and Bodyshops, PERKS is a genuine industry first. A customer loyalty programme which rewards customers with points every time they buy, offers them savings from hundreds of high street brands and retailers, and gives them opportunities to enter regular competitions to win both large and fun prizes.



Following extensive research, and a successful pilot, PERKS has been designed to increase customer engagement by rewarding them for their current buying habits, and encourage them to broaden the range of parts that they consider through carefully targeted promotions. Colin Start, Head of Marketing, Parts & Services at PSA Group said, “Our share of the OEM parts market is always under constant threat, so standing still with our proposition has never been an option. PSA Group have a long history of innovation in the products and services that we bring to market and PERKS is the latest great example of being first to market with new thinking. PERKS has taken a lot of work to get to this stage and we’re confident this is what our customers are looking for.”
