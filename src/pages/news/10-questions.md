**Ok, so what do you actually do? **

So many things, it’s different every day.  

The day flies by – listening to and helping anyone who needs my support, guidance, advice and encouragement. I love solving problems, helping whoever may be struggling with whatever they are struggling with. I’m a great believer in ‘a problem shared is a problem halved’, so being approachable and available to everyone, not only in the agency but to our clients too, is really important to me. Which is why I’m sat answering these questions at 10.30pm! My ‘work’ day starts when the agency closes. 

**What makes working at RLA different to other agencies?**

Most definitely the people. I know that’s probably what most would say, but I genuinely believe that. Agency life can be tough and at RLA we are like a family, supporting each other. Pulling together we can get through anything thrown at us. I know I can rely on everyone in the agency, born survivors! But what’s really important is that we remember to celebrate the good times, thankfully, many more good than difficult ones, and we do celebrate rather well.

Also, an open culture where everyone’s voice can be heard, opinions are welcomed, even challenging ones and people are encouraged to speak up if they have a point of view. A culture where people also listen, recognise and respect that there’s always a different way to look at things and never stop learning

Most manufacturer-run trade parts programmes operate to a business model that is now well over 20 years old. However, parts retailing has changed immeasurably over the last decade with the growth of several disruptive and capable competitors which has seen many OEM’s share of the market slowly decline. But not for RLA’s client, PSA Group who are about to take their already successful Trade Team programme to the next level by launching the industry’s first OEM rewards programme, PERKS, on the 5th June 2017. 

Targeted at 25,000 Independent Garages and Bodyshops, PERKS is a genuine industry first. A customer loyalty programme which rewards customers with points every time they buy, offers them savings from hundreds of high street brands and retailers, and gives them opportunities to enter regular competitions to win both large and fun prizes.
