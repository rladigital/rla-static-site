**Ok, so what do you actually do? **

So many things, it’s different every day.  

The day flies by – listening to and helping anyone who needs my support, guidance, advice and encouragement. I love solving problems, helping whoever may be struggling with whatever they are struggling with. I’m a great believer in ‘a problem shared is a problem halved’, so being approachable and available to everyone, not only in the agency but to our clients too, is really important to me. Which is why I’m sat answering these questions at 10.30pm! My ‘work’ day starts when the agency closes. 

**What makes working at RLA different to other agencies?**

Most definitely the people. I know that’s probably what most would say, but I genuinely believe that. Agency life can be tough and at RLA we are like a family, supporting each other. Pulling together we can get through anything thrown at us. I know I can rely on everyone in the agency, born survivors! But what’s really important is that we remember to celebrate the good times, thankfully, many more good than difficult ones, and we do celebrate rather well.

Also, an open culture where everyone’s voice can be heard, opinions are welcomed, even challenging ones and people are encouraged to speak up if they have a point of view. A culture where people also listen, recognise and respect that there’s always a different way to look at things and never stop learning

**What industry trend or technology are you most excited about? **

My time is extremely precious, and I have little of it, so I’m more interested in Brands that can serve me a relevant ad. They’ve taken an interest, learned my preferences, and talk to me about something I am genuinely interested in buying. Once they serve me an offer, I’m hooked and will buy. I love it when Brands get it so right, because it works. So, it’s been really important to me that RLA stays on top of the marketing automation trend. What I’m really keen to explore now is how this impacts voice assistants. I’ve never been fortunate enough to have a personal assistant in my career, but we are quickly reaching the time when our own personal AI assistant will become part of our everyday lives creating a dependency that we don’t yet know we have. Helping brands make sure they don’t lose out in this next battle is going to be extremely interesting.
