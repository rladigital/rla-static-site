To say it’s been a busy few weeks at RLA, is perhaps putting it lightly. Automechanika was mentioned so many times in the agency, it was almost a \*dirty word\*. At the Drum awards, mid-Automechanika-production-mayhem, our Client told us straight up, that the first person to mention the “A” word buys the drinks. But seriously, it has been amazing to be a part of such an exciting time for PSA. RLA was asked to design the stand walls for Automechanika, produce multiple TV screens, banners and other collateral all required for the exhibition – in a little over two weeks. 

Automechanika is the world's leading trade fair for the automotive service industry and is held annually in the UK at Birmingham’s NEC. It is a global brand and holds its trade fairs in several major cities around the world. The event attracts garage owners, motor factors, dealerships and other key buyers and suppliers in the aftersales market.

PSA’s stand was dual focus – Euro Repar Car Service on one side and Distrigo on the other. Both are relatively new brands for PSA in the UK. Euro Repar Car Service is a fast-growing all-makes garage maintenance and repair network with over 3,000 sites already worldwide. Relatively new to the UK, launched last year, Euro Repar Car Service already has 145 garages nationwide and an ambitious growth target of over 600 within the UK by 2020. 

Distrigo replaces Trade Team as the umbrella name for PSA’s aftersales sector and provides a one-stop shop  for trade customers, giving them access to parts for every type of customer -  supplier branded parts such as Delphi, Bosch and Shaeffler; PSA Group’s accessibly priced Eurorepar all-makes parts brand; as well as Genuine parts for Peugeot, Citroen and DS. 

A highlight of the stand was Josh Cook, a BTCC racing driver who is sponsored by Euro Repar Car Service. Visitors to the stand could “Beat the Driver” on a simulated Donnington race track for a chance to win £150 Snap-on vouchers.
