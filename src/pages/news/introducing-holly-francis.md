**Hey Holly, what’s your new role at RLA, and how are you settling into it?**

I’ve just come in as an Account Executive working on the PSA account. It’s different to any of the industries in which I’ve previously been involved, so it’s all very new and exciting.

**What made you choose RLA?**

RLA’s a well-respected agency comprising big-name clients, with a great company culture and values that reflect my own. If the shoe fits...

**What did you do before starting at RLA? Give us the career/education highlights!**

Whilst studying my degree in marketing I did a placement year in a creative agency right in the heart of Soho, London, which gave me great exposure to the agency world. After graduation I headed off travelling around Asia with my cousin. The biggest highlight? Buying two old-school Honda Wins – having not ridden motorbikes before – and driving them from southern to northern Vietnam!

**What’s different about RLA so far?**

The processes – there are 5000 different platforms and every day seems to bring a new password.

**What were your first impressions of your team?**

Awful (kidding). Right from the offset Jonny nicknamed me Frank and started ripping into me, and Sara and I have a blossoming womance, so I feel right at home. The people definitely make an agency and I’m working with some very funny, talented and down-to-earth individuals.

**What’s your dream client?**

In the automotive industry? Tesla, for sure. The brand speaks for itself, but to be a part of sending one of their Roadsters up into space would be very cool indeed.

**What do you get up to outside of work?**

I love all things sport- and sun-related. So tennis, boxing and gym during the week; tanning, paddleboarding and riding across the Purbecks come the weekend. And, of course, going out and socialising.

**If you could have a superpower what would it be, and why?**

Deal-breaker question... If I was being selfless? Healing. Selfish? Probably flying.

**What is your favourite movie, and why?**

Forest Gump... I don't think I need to explain this one.
