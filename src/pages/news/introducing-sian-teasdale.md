**Whatâ€™s your new role at RLA, and how are you settling into it?

**What were your first impressions of your team? 
**Everyone here at RLA is so super friendly. I feel so at home already and they have been so helpful with introducing me to everyone and getting me set up.

**What did you do before starting at RLA? Give us the career/education highlights! 
**I spent an (un) glamorous few years in the events industry, working at a creative production agency in London and Ibiza. Designing, building and managing events and experiences for some of the worldâ€™s biggest brands, in a variety of sectors! As a Client Manager in the events industry, you really learn to work well under pressure and to extremely tight deadlines!

RLA have a culture that isnâ€™t just smoke and mirrors, they actually mean it. Thereâ€™s a fantastic process and structure to the team.

**Whatâ€™s your dream client? 
**Just a really, really happy client!

**What do you get up to outside of work? 
**I love exploring our beautiful coast, being at the beach, and seeing as many festivals and as much live music as I can!

**What made you choose RLA?
**RLA have an amazing reputation in our industry on the south coast. When I saw the role was available, I just had to go for it.

**If you could have a superpower what would it be, and why?
**I would love to read people's minds! Imagine how awesome our jobs would be then?!

**What is your favourite movie, and why? 
**Star Wars, OBVIOUSLY ðŸ˜‰
