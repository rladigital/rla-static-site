**Hey Sophie, what’s your new role at RLA, and how are you settling into it?**

I’ve joined RLA as an Account Manager and the first few weeks have been great! There’s always loads to be getting on with and exciting client work to get stuck into. There’s plenty to learn and it’s always busy, but luckily everyone’s made me feel at ease. 

**What were your first impressions of your team?**

Hannah and Faye are lovely team members. As with any new role, there are always lots of processes to learn but my team are always more than happy to help and point me in the right direction or pop out for a coffee at lunch. 

**What did you do before starting at RLA? Give us the career/education highlights!**

Before RLA, I was living and working abroad in Paris doing software sales, which is a bit different to what I’m up to now! I studied languages at Uni so I’ve spent some time in France and Italy since graduating. I also worked at a local Marketing Agency where I gained some valuable Client Services experience. 

**What’s different about RLA so far?**

The atmosphere at work. You can tell that everyone enjoys their job and everyone wants to be here, which is refreshing. It also means that for the most part, everything works, and it works well. 

**What’s your dream client?**

Luckily, we get to work with some pretty cool clients here at RLA, but I’d probably say anything that allows me to travel to an exotic location for business or take part in some cool experiential projects; like a wine or spirits brand maybe. 

**What do you get up to outside of work?**

Outside of work you can usually find me on the beach or finding new local spots for food, and attempting to maintain a regular gym schedule. 

**What made you choose RLA?**

Location and company culture were strong factors for me, as well as an impressive client base. We have a beautiful office, and any commute that involves an emu and an alpaca is a winner in my eyes! 

**If you could have a superpower what would it be, and why?**

I think it would have to be time travel. Or the ability to stop time. Because who doesn’t need an extra hour in their day?

**What is your favourite movie, and why?**

Anything with Leonardo di Caprio, which is self-explanatory really!
