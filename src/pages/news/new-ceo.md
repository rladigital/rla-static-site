Mike joins us from Innocean UK, where he was the General Manager responsible for doubling the agency’s size, as well as the principal lead for their Hyundai and Kia accounts.

Before that Mike was Client Services Director at Havas, where he led the Citroen account across both fleet and retail. He’s held a number of senior roles at some big names in advertising and marketing, including WCRS, Lowe Worldwide and Leo Burnett.

Former RLA CEO Chris Goodwin has now moved on to be Commercial Director of The Mission Marketing Group plc, RLA’s parent company. Chris said, “We are all thrilled to have Mike head up the RLA team. His strong agency background, more recently in the automotive sector, coupled with his proven business development capability is just what RLA needs to fuel its growth aspirations. This is an exciting year for RLA with interesting opportunities both nationally and internationally.”

Mike said, “I have seen the great work RLA produce and been impressed with their delivery and execution. Chris and the team have grown the Agency to where it stands today and I am hugely excited to pick that up and continue to drive it forward.”
