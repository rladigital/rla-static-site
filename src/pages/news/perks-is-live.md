Most manufacturer-run trade parts programmes operate to a business model that
is now well over 20 years old. However, parts retailing has changed
immeasurably over the last decade with the growth of several disruptive and
capable competitors which has seen many OEM’s share of the market slowly
decline. But not for RLA’s client, PSA Group who are about to take their
already successful Trade Team programme to the next level by launching the
industry’s first OEM rewards programme, PERKS, on the 5th June 2017.

Targeted at 25,000 Independent Garages and Bodyshops, PERKS is a genuine
industry first. A customer loyalty programme which rewards customers with
points every time they buy, offers them savings from hundreds of high street
brands and retailers, and gives them opportunities to enter regular
competitions to win both large and fun prizes.

Following extensive research, and a successful pilot, PERKS has been designed
to increase customer engagement by rewarding them for their current buying
habits, and encourage them to broaden the range of parts that they consider
through carefully targeted promotions.

Colin Start, Head of Marketing, Parts & Services at PSA Group said, “Our share
of the OEM parts market is always under constant threat, so standing still
with our proposition has never been an option. PSA Group have a long history
of innovation in the products and services that we bring to market and PERKS
is the latest great example of being first to market with new thinking. PERKS
has taken a lot of work to get to this stage and we’re confident this is what
our customers are looking for.”

Samantha Butcher, Managing Director at RLA said, “We’ve been responsible for
the design, delivery and communication of more OEM trade programmes than any
other supplier today. In 21 years of work with 13 OEM parts programmes across
27 countries, there has only been a few major innovations – and PERKS is one
of them. The fact that PERKS is coming to the market at all is testament to
the forward thinking nature of Colin and PSA Group and their absolute desire
to grow their share of the market.”

PERKS, the parts rewards programme from Trade Team launches 5th June 2017.
