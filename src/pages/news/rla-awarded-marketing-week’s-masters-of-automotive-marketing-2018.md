We are thrilled to announce that RLA have been [named as overall Winner and Sector Masters in Automotive at the Marketing Week Masters Awards 2018](https://www.marketingweek.com/2018/10/09/marketing-week-masters-awards-2018-sector-winners/). The award follows the effective launch of PERKS, the first car manufacturer trade loyalty programme for Groupe PSA (the holding company for Peugeot, Citroën and DS Automobiles) in June 2017.

The Marketing Week Masters Awards took place at London’s Tobacco Dock on 9th October. The biggest of their kind in the UK, the awards cover everything in marketing from strategy through to execution.

RLA were [nominated as Marketing Week Masters](https://www.marketingweek.com/2018/07/17/masters-awards-shortlist-sector-masters/) in both the Automotive and B2B categories, emerging victorious in the Automotive category, and staving off some seriously stiff competition from Adam & Eve DDB’s impressive Volkswagen ‘[Rammed with Confidence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJAkPVVYt54)’ campaign and Shell’s innovative ‘[The Coffee Line](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyGXsV4UtlQ)’ communication.

So, what made PERKS such a resounding success?

> **Good, smart idea well executed in a challenging sector**

A 25% uplift in sales in a declining market for car manufacturers is the reward PSA received from a brave and innovative approach to engaging with their customers. Fundamental to our success in achieving the Marketing Week Masters of Automotive Award was building a unique tool that innovatively unified customer and sales data that had previously been spread across the retail network. This provided insights into previously unattainable customer behaviour and allowed the development of an automated communications programme, transforming a very traditional approach to marketing into the leading-edge creative solution in the sector.

> **Innovative solution, strong ROI and growth in a declining category**

Algorithms were designed using propensity modelling, to deliver bespoke incentives to individual customers dependent upon their current purchasing habits and the likelihood to buy from additional categories.

> **Genuinely innovative and highly effective**

Research, testing, due diligence, and a brave client have created a customer-centric programme that has transformed PSA’s trade marketing, sparked a desire amongst local garages to participate, and delivered unseen levels of engagement with communications and a quicker than expected impact on sales.

PERKS has been, and continues to be, a successful fusion of creativity, technology, and strategic thinking. We are incredibly proud to have been successful, particularly against some of the best Automotive marketing strategies in the country, and are excited to see where our journey with Groupe PSA will continue to take us.
