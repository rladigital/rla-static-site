“Masters of Automotive”. Not our words. But our peers’.  To better understand their context – we had just launched PERKS, the automated loyalty programme that we’d designed and built for PSA Group. And though months of hard work had gone on behind closed doors, the dust had barely settled on the programme launch before we found ourselves at the Marketing Week Awards.

Several warm beers (and a few fiercely guarded bottles of prosecco) into the evening, we were merrily rubbing  shoulders with the best and brightest in the business; the nearest table looking particularly dapper made us realise  we were toe-to-toe with ASOS’s creative team (though with  half of us wearing ASOS garb it wasn’t as awkward as you might think).

<strong>“GENUINELY INNOVATIVE AND HIGHLY EFFECTIVE”</strong><br><br>

Our eyes darted nervously around the table as it was time for the ‘Automotive’ category award presentation. As the nominees were read out, we soon realised we were about to butt heads with Adam&Eve/DDB and their T-Roc ram campaign.

More ‘industry judges aligning’ than ‘stars aligning’, moments later we were being hauled onstage with Lauren Laverne, and the Automotive Masters award thrust into our hands. The plucky David had taken on a room of Goliaths and won. So what did the judges have to say about PERKS?

<strong>“A good, smart idea well executed in a challenging sector”</strong>

<strong>“PERKS is an Innovative solution, with strong ROI and growth in a declining category”</strong>

<strong>“The programme is genuinely innovative and highly effective”</strong>

The celebrations went on into the night... and if you ever find a bow tie looking ownerless near Tobacco Dock, please do get in touch with our Head of Strategy.

So there it was, RLA were named overall Winner and Sector Master for the Automotive category at the Marketing Week Masters awards for 2018 – #micdrop. It’s not an award that’s won lightly either. A major industry publication and the largest marketing awards in the UK. Alongside a category filled with excellent global work for Volkswagen, Shell, DS and Ford from prestigious agencies such as Adam&Eve/DDB, PHD and H+K Strategies.

Our PERKS loyalty programme was the first always-on, manufacturer trade rewards programme for local garages. We soft-released late 2016 and 18 months later we had driven a 20% YoY uplift in sales with member customers. Those of you who know your onions from your Öhlins, will know just how hard a task that scale of growth is.

On the surface it might seem simple, but the reality of being able to stabilise and enrich fractious DMS data to a high enough quality to be able to perform robust RFM analysis, in a manner similar to Tesco’s Clubcard, is no mean feat.

And the result is a cutting-edge programme delivering daily automated reward points calculations, unique reward tracking dashboards for every customer, and personalised communications targeting both individual Our PERKS loyalty programme was the first always-on, manufacturer trade rewards programme for local garages.
