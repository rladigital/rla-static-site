Support Manager & Web Developer and code artisan at heart, he can usually be found squashing bugs, deep in code, attempting to reprogram the matrix. Or in meetings. Lots of meetings. When he is let out of the office he can be occasionally spotted bounding through the forest or enjoying the fresh air at the beach, spinning flaming balls of fire around his head.
