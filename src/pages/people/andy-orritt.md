Andy has been in the industry for over twenty five years, as a digital printer, artworker, studio manager and traffic manager. He would love to have an amazing list of out of work interests, but has three children, so his free time is taken up with driving to and from under 12's football, standing on Lego and watching the same animated film over and over and over again.
