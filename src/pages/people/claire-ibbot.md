Full of vim and vigour, Claire joined RLA fresh from achieving a First Class Honours degree in Advertising at Bournemouth University. With a precise and accurate approach to all tasks, she has earned her stripes as an Account Manager and is an asset to the team. Claire is a Durham native, but her knowledge of local adventures puts us all to shame.
