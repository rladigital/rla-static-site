Helena has a degree in Maths and an MSc in Operational Research, so unsurprisingly she loves numbers and data. Nothing makes her happier than working out what problems our clients have that we can solve with brilliant websites. She recently got into keep fit and spends most of her spare time running, swimming and cycling with her teenage son, in an attempt to get ready for some daunting triathlons over the summer.
