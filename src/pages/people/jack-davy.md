Jack has worked in creative teams in London, Sydney and Bournemouth for over a decade. Working across advertising, social, brand and experiential spaces, he brings a wide range of experience to the team. He also works as a Tutor at the Arts University Bournemouth, loves Point Break, and is trying to make the nickname ‘Utah’ happen. (It doesn’t seem to be working.)
