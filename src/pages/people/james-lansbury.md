With a degree in Geology and a history of being a photographer, musician, fire dancer and salsa teacher, becoming a Data Analyst was an obvious choice for James. He has visited 26% (51) of the world’s countries, in which he has tried over 100 different brands of chocolate milk. Statistically speaking, James is likely to be the best snake hipped, salsa teaching data analyst that you’ve ever met.
