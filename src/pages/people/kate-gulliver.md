One of the longest serving members, Kate joined RLA in 2002 and has never left – apart from having two children that is.  As our Receptionist and Media Executive, Kate looks after local authority advertising and all that is reception.  Free time spent on sidelines of pitch, track or court supporting son playing football, athletics or badminton whilst watching daughter in musical theatre. It’s all go.
