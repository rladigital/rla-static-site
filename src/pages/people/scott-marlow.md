Scott has been in the design game since leaving school over 25 years ago, and *loves* it when you remind him of that fact. With everything from Art editing gardening magazines, heading up consumer catalogue departments and art directing photoshoots in South Africa there's not a lot he hasn't done. His current passions are motion graphics and 3d modelling, preferably, the two rolled into one.
