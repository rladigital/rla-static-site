Tom's skills involve solving problems in the most elegant, future proof way. He also likes to talk, quite a lot. Keeping on top of latest development techniques and best practices is a work and personal passion. Outside of tech, in his spare time Tom enjoys spending time with his family and (over)indulging in the odd real ale.
