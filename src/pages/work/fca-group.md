      A modular Cortex solution was implemented, including Synapse (our data
      unification platform) and Territory (our branch marketing platform). The
      project resulted in a 52% saving in the total programme budget versus
      previous suppliers, an 80% reduction on Cost Per Lead for targeted
      Facebook campaigns, and a 324% growth in voluntary branch advertising
      asset usage over 3 years.
