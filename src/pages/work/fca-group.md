    title: THE PROJECT
  - description: >-
      The key to driving dealer engagement was a combination of both our unique
      portal technology and the quality of our in-house dealer service
      infrastructure. Interaction through the portal had to be seamless,
      intuitive and deliver to dealer needs. The FCA portal  we created provided
      complete transparency on dealer performance and marketing activity,
      meaning RLA could deliver a proactive service, focusing on underperforming
      dealers and assisting them to improve sales.
