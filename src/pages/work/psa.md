  - description: "For years, PSA (the holding company for Peugeot, Citroen and DS Automobiles) always used traditional advertising to encourage independent garages to buy their parts. Results were fair, but understandably they wanted better. We were tasked with taking their parts sales to the next level.\r"

    title: The Problem
  - description: "Our solution was to create the first car manufacturer Trade Rewards Scheme. We built a tool that would give insight into a centralised pool of sales data and customer behaviours that had not previously been possible. Using propensity modelling, algorithms would be designed to deliver bespoke incentives to individual customers, dependent upon their current purchase habits and their likelihood to buy from additional categories. It would all be driven by regular competitions and rewarding parts purchases with points redeemable at Amazon.co.uk and Snap-on.\r"

    title: The Strategy
  - description: "Research, testing, due diligence, and a brave client have created a customer-centric programme that has generated a 25% uplift in PSA’s trade marketing, and delivered unseen levels of engagement with communications.\n\n\r\rTo date we have given away over £160,000 worth of goodies from £5 lunch vouchers up to hugely popular track days, and have created real buzz amongst customers, regularly receiving emails giving us lots of positive feedback about the programme.\r\n\nOh, and we were also finalists for B2B Marketing Strategy of the year at The Drum Marketing Awards 2018. \r"
