      Groupe PSA, the French parent company of the iconic Peugeot, Citroen and
      DS brands, are redefining the role of the OEM in the automotive
      aftermarket. With a well-documented ‘Push to Pass’ strategy paying huge
      dividends in returning the group to profit, a large element of that
      strategy contains a trailblazing expansion into the ownership of several
      non-OEM aftermarket brands.

      The challenge for Groupe PSA was unique. What do you do when you find
      yourself owning not one, but several competing, occasionally conflicting
      whole-chain brands with fundamentally different messages, needing to
      present to a broad range of micro-audiences? 


      The answer – appoint RLA, the leading automotive specialist marketing
      agency, to apply their proven aftermarket experience in managing your
      brands’ communications activities.

  - description: "Research, testing, due diligence, and a brave client have created a customer-centric programme that has generated a 25% uplift in PSA’s trade marketing, and delivered unseen levels of engagement with communications.\n\n\r\rTo date we have given away over £160,000 worth of goodies from £5 lunch vouchers up to hugely popular track days, and have created real buzz amongst customers, regularly receiving emails giving us lots of positive feedback about the programme.\r\n\nOh, and we were also finalists for B2B Marketing Strategy of the year at The Drum Marketing Awards 2018. \r"
