      Groupe PSA, the French parent company of the iconic Peugeot, Citroen and
      DS brands, are redefining the role of the OEM in the automotive
      aftermarket. With a well-documented ‘Push to Pass’ strategy paying huge
      dividends in returning the group to profit, a large element of that
      strategy contains a trailblazing expansion into the ownership of several
      non-OEM aftermarket brands.

      The challenge for Groupe PSA was unique. What do you do when you find
      yourself owning not one, but several competing, occasionally conflicting
      whole-chain brands with fundamentally different messages, needing to
      present to a broad range of micro-audiences? 


      The answer – appoint RLA, the leading automotive specialist marketing
      agency, to apply their proven aftermarket experience in managing your
      brands’ communications activities.

      Eurorepar parts, two wholesale and trade operations under Distrigo and
      Trade Team banners, Europe’s first OEM parts loyalty programme: PERKS, the
      all-makes independent garage franchise of Euro Repar Car Service, and
      finally several online parts and service e-commerce and aggregation
      websites: Autobutler.com, MrAuto.com and WhoCanFixMyCar.com. Phew!
