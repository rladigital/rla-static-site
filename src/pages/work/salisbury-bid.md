  # THE PROJECT


  Transform the local marketing effectiveness for the whole UK Fiat Chrysler
  Automobiles business â€“ a network of 6 brands (Fiat, Alfa Romeo, Jeep,
  Chrysler, Abarth and Fiat Professional), 315 dealer branches, 6 regions, 10
  principle brand clients and 14 secondary clients across sales, product,
  training, Aftersales and Financial Services.


  # THE OUTCOME


  A modular Cortex solution was implemented, including Synapse (our data
  unification platform) and Territory (our branch marketing platform). The
  project resulted in a 52% saving in the total programme budget versus previous
  suppliers, an 80% reduction on Cost Per Lead for targeted Facebook campaigns,
  and a 324% growth in voluntary branch advertising asset usage over 3 years.
