  # THE PROJECT


  Salisbury Business Improvement District tasked us to increase footfall and
  engagement within the city and to encourage locals and people in the
  surrounding areas to visit. So we grew an organic email database that is
  specifically GDPR compliant. We also leveraged Facebook lead generation
  adverts and third-party email newsletters, culminating in a Christmas campaign
  promoting the hugely popular Christmas market.


  # THE OUTCOME


  Within the first week our data capture campaign via Facebook lead generation
  posts built up an organic email database of 1,500 and a substantial social
  media following who are now happy to be targeted with events, offers and news.
  In light of the GDPR ruling requiring the publicâ€™s consent for further
  communications we were delighted that 67% of recipients opted IN.
