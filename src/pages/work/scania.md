  - description: "When we first met Scania in 2010, we met a world-leader in engineering capability, quality and technology. Revered by diehard customers and those in the know inside the industry. But we also met a company losing ground to resurgent competitors in Mercedes and Volvo. Scania, the best built, but most expensive truck on the market (by some margin) wasn’t justifying it’s premium in a meaningful way to repel the competition.\r"

  - description: "At Scania, the engineers rule the roost. Product is king. And oh boy, is Scania’s product supreme in almost every commercially important KPI when running a haulage business. So why then, is this strength not accepted by too many customers across several markets? Because a chronic lack of focus on brand positioning and compelling persuasion was contriving to ensure that the Scania proposition lacked purpose and difference. On a global scale. A criminal situation when the core product was so good.\r"

    title: A product vs brand imbalance
  - description: "In the UK, the competition had closed the gap. They had successfully raised awareness and the belief they were as good, if not better, than Scania. So, we undertook a root and branch review of the UK marketplace and rebuilt the brand’s positioning within the UK. A rallying call, “You Can”, with the backing of a full-throttle, through-the-line campaign captured the imagination of the industry, propelling Scania up the desirability stakes. Reinforced extensively internally, the campaign ran in multiple stages for 7 years and re-established Scania as the number one, most desirable brand in the market.\r"

  - description: "Our operational success brought numerous market extensions to RLA. The Southern Africa region, Central Eastern Europe and South East Asia with projects as diverse as ownership CRM, Parts loyalty campaigns and a premium launch event for the new luxury coach in Singapore to name a few. Culminating in RLA’s latest major account which is to propel the Chinese market performance from unmentionably small to the largest truck market for Scania in the world by 2023. \r"
