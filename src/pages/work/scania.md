      Our initial task was to recover growing lost ground in their premium
      status versus the competition of Volvo and Mercedes truck, who were
      rapidly closing the gap on the UK’s number 1 heavy truck brand.

      With a ground-up rebuild of the brands statement in the market, RLA’s “You
      Can” rallying call creative, launched to immediate acclaim, capturing the
      imagination of the industry en-mass. Fully integrated across the entire
      brand marketing mix; ATL through Dealer templates and digital / social

    title: The Strategy
  - description: >-
      With market share growing for the first time in three years, and
      continuing every year (growing from 14% – 22%), we were invited to pitch
      for the Southern African market to repeat our success. We won and since
      2013 we have been engaged in significant multi-market, multi-race creative
      to match the scale of the African task. 


      In four years we have helped take Scania from 8th to 2nd in market. 


      2017 saw our first campaigns break for our latest market, China.
