      When we first met Scania in 2010, we met a world-leader in engineering
      capability, quality and technology. The brand was revered by diehard
      customers and those in the know within the industry. But we also met a
      company losing ground to resurgent competitors in Mercedes and Volvo.
      Scania, the best built, but most expensive truck on the market (by some
      margin), just wasn’t justifying its premium enough to hold off the
      competition.

      At Scania, the engineers rule the roost. Product is king and Scania’s
      product reigns supreme in almost every commercial KPI when running a
      haulage business. If the product itself was performing, then the problem
      was a lack of awareness. A lack of focus on brand positioning and
      compelling persuasion was contriving to ensure that Scania’s proposition
      lacked purpose and standout – a problem with a global scale.

      In the UK, the competition had closed the gap. They had successfully
      raised awareness of themselves as viable (if not better) alternatives to
      Scania. We began by undertaking a root and branch review of the UK
      marketplace, rebuilding the brand’s positioning within the UK. 


      Distilling the essence of what the haulage industry is about, we launched
      the rallying call, “You Can”. With the backing of a full-throttle,
      through-the-line campaign, this message of empowerment captured the
      imagination of the industry. The campaign, reinforced extensively with
      internal activity, ran in multiple stages for seven years, re-asserting
      Scania as the number one, most desirable brand in the market.

      Our operational success brought numerous market extensions to RLA,
      including the Southern Africa region, Central Eastern Europe and South
      East Asia. The breadth of RLA’s involvement expanded too, with projects as
      diverse as ownership CRM, Parts loyalty campaigns and a premium launch
      event for the new luxury coach in Singapore – to name just a few.

      Our work with Scania has resulted in an outstanding collection of
      brand-driven results which we are very proud of:  

      **No.1** for brand awareness, consideration, likeability and impact.  

      **From 14% to 22%** sustained market share in UK  

      **From 8th to 2nd** in-market position within four years for Southern
      Africa region  


      Our work with Scania has culminated in RLA’s latest major win – a truly
      exciting five-year project aiming to propel Scania’s market performance in
      China from that of a minor contender, to the largest global market for
      Scania by 2023.
