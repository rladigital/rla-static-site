      The problem for Tesco has always been vocal minority belief that their
      growth aspirations will 'kill' local town communities by forcing local
      butchers, bakers and farmers out of business. RLA were challenged to help
      change this perception in Northern Ireland.

    title: The Project
  - description: >-
      In 2014 our localisation campaign "Switch to Local" utilised beautiful
      photography of numerous key local farmers and suppliers in the province to
      bring the diverse and committed local suppliers in the front of Tesco
      Advertising. 


      Through a heavy weight regional broadcast campaign in outdoor and press we
      also integrated the campaign with personalised POS, DM, email, local press
      and local events for each of the stores.

    title: The Strategy
  - description: >-
      After 20 years, Tesco has started to thrive in the Irish community and now
      the largest grocer in the market.


      The success of the campaign meant that RLA were the first ever agency to
      be awarded Tesco's 'Supplier of the Month' Award (which is normally
      reserved for suppliers such as growers and farmers).
