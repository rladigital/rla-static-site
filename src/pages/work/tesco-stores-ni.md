  # THE PROJECT


  To counter the incorrect perception that Tesco’s growth aspiration will
  squeeze local farmers, butchers and bakers out of business. ‘Switch to Local’
  is support-building campaign that features beautiful photos to showcase the
  impressive number of local farmers who are happily supplying the supermarket
  chain.


  # THE OUTCOME


  Through a heavyweight regional broadcast campaign in outdoor and press, also
  including POS, DM, eDM, local press and events, RLA became the first agency to
  be awarded Tesco’s Supplier of the Month award. An accolade normally reserved
  for the actual farmers and growers. A little ironic, perhaps!
