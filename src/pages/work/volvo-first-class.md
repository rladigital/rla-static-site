      You don’t have to look too far back to see Volvo in a bit of a darker
      place than they are today. A worthy but dated model line-up, their lowest
      market share for decades, a slightly disenfranchised but loyal network,
      and a confused brand message that had turned the volume down on safety –
      the one thing Volvo were famous for. These issues played out and were
      amplified by the backdrop of a post-recession landscape, one that had
      already claimed the other famous Swedish car brand. 


      It all felt very difficult, and very uncertain. Then everything changed.
      Geely, the Chinese automotive conglomerate, took over the reigns,
      completely changing the future landscape for the brand. With a
      multi-million investment plan, new model horizon and an inbound new MD for
      the UK, Volvo began to completely refocus their network’s confidence and
      their approach to market. Enter ‘Cortex Engage’ – RLA’s employee
      engagement platform.

      In 2013, RLA undertook an important brief – to affect a ground-up rebuild
      of the business’ approach to aligning the network for growth. As a result,
      we launched the Volvo First Class programme – a full-service agency
      solution, tech platform and strategic programme. Providing all creativity,
      communications, data, analysis, behaviour targeting, recognition and
      reward, and a direct link to Amazon’s Business API for fulfilment.

  - description: "We proposed a complete staff incentive platform to be run in collaboration with Volvo’s Sales, Aftersales, Operations, Marketing and Academy teams. It was called Volvo First Class. The whole-business programme targeted a broad variation of soft and hard behaviours - with 1,500 unique users, eight regions and unique personalised logins enabling gamification, leagues, quizzes, badges, spot prizes, Hall of Fame and Amazon access. All culminating in a series of exclusive dinners and international events from Rome to Japan.\r"
