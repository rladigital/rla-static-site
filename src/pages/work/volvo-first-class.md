    title: The Problem
  - description: "We proposed a complete staff incentive platform to be run in collaboration with Volvo’s Sales, Aftersales, Operations, Marketing and Academy teams. It was called Volvo First Class. The whole-business programme targeted a broad variation of soft and hard behaviours - with 1,500 unique users, eight regions and unique personalised logins enabling gamification, leagues, quizzes, badges, spot prizes, Hall of Fame and Amazon access. All culminating in a series of exclusive dinners and international events from Rome to Japan.\r"
