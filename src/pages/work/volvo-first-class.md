  - description: "Having run cash-based sales incentives for a number of years, Volvo had only focused on motivating the sales teams. Aftersales staff, product knowledge, customer satisfaction and key brand behaviours were all being neglected. In 2013, Volvo had major growth and brand development aspirations – all of which required a modern engagement and incentive platform for all employees as part of a new strategy.\r"
    title: The Problem
  - description: "We proposed a complete staff incentive platform to be run in collaboration with Volvo’s Sales, Aftersales, Operations, Marketing and Academy teams. It was called Volvo First Class. The whole-business programme targeted a broad variation of soft and hard behaviours - with 1,500 unique users, eight regions and unique personalised logins enabling gamification, leagues, quizzes, badges, spot prizes, Hall of Fame and Amazon access. All culminating in a series of exclusive dinners and international events from Rome to Japan.\r"
