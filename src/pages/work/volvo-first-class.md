      You don’t have to look too far back to see Volvo in a bit of a darker
      place than they are today. A worthy but dated model line-up, their lowest
      market share for decades, a slightly disenfranchised but loyal network,
      and a confused brand message that had turned the volume down on safety –
      the one thing Volvo were famous for. These issues played out and were
      amplified by the backdrop of a post-recession landscape, one that had
      already claimed the other famous Swedish car brand. 


      It all felt very difficult, and very uncertain. Then everything changed.
      Geely, the Chinese automotive conglomerate, took over the reigns,
      completely changing the future landscape for the brand. With a
      multi-million investment plan, new model horizon and an inbound new MD for
      the UK, Volvo began to completely refocus their network’s confidence and
      their approach to market. Enter ‘Cortex Engage’ – RLA’s employee
      engagement platform.

      In 2013, RLA undertook an important brief – to affect a ground-up rebuild
      of the business’ approach to aligning the network for growth. As a result,
      we launched the Volvo First Class programme – a full-service agency
      solution, tech platform and strategic programme. Providing all creativity,
      communications, data, analysis, behaviour targeting, recognition and
      reward, and a direct link to Amazon’s Business API for fulfilment.

    title: RESETTING THE FRAMEWORK FOR SUCCESS

      We deployed RLA’s unique Cortex Engage platform to motivate staff – a
      bespoke front-end portal design and a series of gamification modules
      including leagues, competitions, quizzes, games, badges and points. The
      technical platform provided the basis for all daily communications and
      measurement control. All were fully loaded with beautiful, creative,
      personalised engagement comms, tailored by job role and individual
      performance. These would deliver numerous recognition events, dinners,
      seminars and international trips from Rome to Japan.
